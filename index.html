			<img id="bio-image" src="assets/images/keh.jpg" alt="Karen Henderson">

			<p>It seems that I have come full circle. When I first started college ("I'm not telling you when that was!"), I wanted to be a programmer, or so I thought. A computer science major consisted of alot of math classes, so no, thank you! With a business management major and comp sci minor, I began my career.</p>

			<p>Fast forward a few (ok, several) years. After having done desktop support, software deployment, going to culinary school and owning a tea room, the prodigal has returned home. Let's meet over a cup of tea!</p>
